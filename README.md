# Basic API with Hapi and MongoDB

On this example I created a Products API, you can setup your own MongoDb databse url and try the next list of routes:

* GET `/api/products`
* POST `/api/products`
* GET `/api/products/{id}`
* PUT `/api/products/{id}`
* DELETE `/api/products/{id}`

Project dependencies:

```
 "dependencies": {
    "global": "^4.3.2",
    "hapi": "^17.4.0",
    "inert": "^5.1.0",
    "mongoose": "^5.0.17",
    "nodemon": "^1.17.3"
  }
```
